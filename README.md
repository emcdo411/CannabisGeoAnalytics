# Repository Name: `CannabisGeoAnalytics`

## Project Title: Geospatial Analysis of Cannabis Cultivation and Disease Risk

### Summary
This repository presents a comprehensive geospatial analysis toolkit developed in R using the `leaflet` package to visualize hemp cultivation metrics and crop disease risks. Initially designed to map hemp farm data—including THC compliance and predicted yields—the project evolved to incorporate environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, and soil quality (pH and organic carbon). The final iteration extends the framework to model crop disease spread, integrating weather data to explore its influence on disease risk. These interactive visualizations provide actionable insights for cannabis researchers, farmers, and policymakers by linking environmental conditions to cultivation outcomes and disease prevalence.

The work was developed on March 25, 2025, with continuous refinement to ensure robustness and scalability. This toolkit is ideal for academic presentations, agricultural decision-making, and further research into cannabis biology.

## Features
- **Hemp Cultivation Mapping**: Visualizes farm locations with THC probability and yield data using color-coded markers.
- **Environmental Overlays**: Integrates precipitation (as markers or heatmaps), temperature (heatmaps), and soil quality (custom markers).
- **Disease Risk Analysis**: Models crop disease spread with risk probabilities and infection counts, correlated with weather data.
- **Interactive Controls**: Layer toggles and legends enhance user exploration of complex datasets.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes checks for empty datasets and NA values to ensure reliable execution.

## Why This Matters
This project bridges cannabis biology and geospatial analytics, offering a powerful tool for understanding how environmental factors influence hemp cultivation and disease susceptibility. For hemp farmers, visualizing THC compliance alongside yield and soil data can optimize cultivation practices and ensure regulatory adherence. The disease risk extension is particularly critical as cannabis legalization expands—diseases like powdery mildew or root rot can devastate crops, and their spread is often tied to weather patterns (e.g., high humidity from precipitation or warm temperatures). By mapping these variables, researchers like Dr. Jose Leme can identify risk hotspots, test hypotheses about environmental drivers, and develop mitigation strategies. This work supports sustainable agriculture, enhances crop resilience, and contributes to the scientific foundation of cannabis as a viable commercial crop.

## Conclusion
The `CannabisGeoAnalytics` repository showcases a scalable, interactive framework for geospatial analysis of cannabis-related data. From THC compliance to disease risk, it integrates diverse datasets into a unified visualization platform. This toolkit is ready for academic scrutiny and practical application, making it an asset for Dr. Jose Leme’s research at SIU and beyond. Future enhancements could include time-series analysis, machine learning predictions, or integration with real-time weather APIs.
